# Project
## Introduction 
This .xlsx file aims to apply my knowledge in conditional formatting, pivot tables, dynamic filters, lookup formulas, and dynamic charts. After 7 months, I decided to enhance the project by including a detailed analysis of key performance indicators and recommendations for strategic actions based on the results obtained. This improvement is intended to provide a deeper and more actionable insight into the data.
## Why not use only Microsoft Excel?
While Microsoft Excel is excellent for data organization and visualization, it has limitations for more complex analyses. For this specific dataset, Excel is suitable and efficient. However, tools like Python can offer additional solutions for data manipulation and analysis, especially in cases that require more flexibility, allowing for the creation of automated reports and more intuitive extraction of insights.

While Excel was essential for the initial visualization and analysis, Python would complement the project by providing additional functionalities that are often difficult to achieve with Excel alone.
## Relevant Indicators for Revenue Evaluation
In addition to the main indicators presented on the dashboard (Sales by Country and Top 5 Clients), I selected other indicators that can provide additional relevant information about the revenue generated:

- Which type of coffee has the lowest profit margin?
- Which roast generates the most profit?
- Which roast has the highest sales volume?
- Which size has the highest sales volume?
- Which size generates the most profit?
- Which size has the lowest profit margin?
